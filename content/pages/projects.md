Assigned Paper
--------------

A proposed paper topic is due prior to the paper itself. The topic should consist of a paragraph describing the device and the major materials issues associated with it, citing at least two to three references. The completed paper is due three weeks later, at the beginning of class.

### Purpose

To provide students an opportunity to synthesize concepts learned in the course in an in-depth examination of a device employing electrical, optical, or magnetic materials.

Emphasis will be placed on the development of individual writing and literature review skills.

Organization of the Paper
-------------------------

1.  Introduction: Interest and relevance, 1-2 paragraphs
2.  Principles of Operation: This should be as brief as possible, but it needs to inform the reader how the device works so that s/he can appreciate the materials choices that need to be made
3.  Materials Choices: Describe what materials are used in the device and why?
4.  Present Limitations and Opportunities for Materials Improvements: How are the properties of the existing materials limiting device performance? Where is the technology heading, and what new materials might be used in future generation devices?

Sections 3 and 4 should comprise the bulk of your report.
